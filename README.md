# ml-from-scratch
This repo is my implementation of various ML techniques from scratch.

I am following *Sebastian Raschka's* **Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn**. You may purchase the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-PyTorch-Scikit-Learn-learning-ebook/dp/B09NW48MR1).

In each folder, run the `explore.py` notebook. My handwritten notes are labelled `notes.pdf`.
